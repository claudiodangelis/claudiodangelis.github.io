As anticipated a [few weeks back](/code/2018/01/29/reworking-popup-for-keep.html), I was in the middle of a major refactoring of [Popup For Keep](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/popup-for-keep/fhcmhglnohogibbbpbodmjeggpdlboop), a simple Chrome extension that lets you easily open Google Keep into a top-right corner of the browser and/or have it as a floating popup.

Refactoring was required due to an increasing number of feature request, the original codebase was quite patchy and hard to maintain.

As a user, you shouldn't be expecting any major difference from the previous version. However, any feedback is always welcome.

The refactoring is now complete, so I can start working on new features like having a resizeable popup. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

**Popup For Keep** is an open source product, any contribution is welcome, you can find the source code at [Github](https://github.com/claudiodangelis/popup-for-).
