Finally I got time to fix a long time bug affecting users of Google Suite For Work/Education using [Popup For Keep](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/popup-for-keep/fhcmhglnohogibbbpbodmjeggpdlboop). 

Everything should be working correctly now as per version **0.10.0** which should be already available in the Chrome Web Store at this time.
