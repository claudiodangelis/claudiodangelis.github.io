I published a very simple theme for Visual Studio Code: everything is gray, strings dark yellow.

This theme is generated with [Tyriar/vscode-theme-generator](https://github.com/Tyriar/vscode-theme-generator) and you can get it from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=claudiodangelis.dun-theme).
