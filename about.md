Hi, my name is Claudio d'Angelis and this is my website, I'm a freelance developer and IT consultant based in Italy.

I'm currently employed in the advertising technology (ad tech) industry.

Besides **general purpose programming** in Go or JavaScript, my areas of expertise include:

- Tasks Automation
- Web Scraping
- Data Mining

I'm a big fan of [Frank Zappa](http://wiki.killuglyradio.com/wiki/Frank_Zappa) and [Banco Del Mutuo Soccorso](http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=36), and I travel a lot.
